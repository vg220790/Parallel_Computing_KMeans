Project by: Victoria Glazunov

The project opens the usual way on a computer with CUDA

You only need to change INPUT_PATH and OUTPUT_PATH definitions:

1. Enter the Header.h file 
2. In the #define section there is a definition for INPUT_PATH and OUTPUT_PATH 
3. Change it to "<project location on your device>\\KMeans3D\\KMeans3D\\input.txt"
		"<project location on your device>\\KMeans3D\\KMeans3D\\output.txt"
